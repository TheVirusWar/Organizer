# Organizer

Software I created as a practice. It features a simple design, and I created it for me to use it. Because I transfer a lot of movies and shows to a usb flash drive to watch on TV,
and due to my TV not recognizing subtitles unless they're named exactly the same as a video file they go with, I made a "File Organizer" option, that renames files numerically,
sorting them (without order of input, it was a design choice). Also in the program theres a "Movie Sorter" option, that pairs movies and subtitles and puts them in a custom folder.

This was also my practice with differnt views.
